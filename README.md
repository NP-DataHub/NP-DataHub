# NP-DataHub
Data Visualization/ML Platform that Assesses 
Nonprofits and Sector-Based Ecosystems

OVERVIEW

Even though there are databases that cater to donors and monitor baseline financial activity for nonprofits based on documents, there is no one resource that allows the end-user to visualize fiscal performance and examine longitudinal data for each nonprofit and an entire non-profit sector, of which there are 26 as defined by the IRS. There also isnâ€™t a sector-based platform that can produce prescriptive and predictive forecasting through algorithmic construction and other ML/AI capabilities.

Based on public IRS data, culled over eight years, we will build a platform allowing the end-user to visualize non-profit fiscal performance to help inform grantmakers, donors, and public policymakers make more accurate and efficient decisions. Essentially, this platform will be similar to the Bloomberg terminal but for nonprofits. This will be accomplished by combining public data solutions and including predictive insights and potential AI functionality. Algorithms are already created and will eventually be integrated.

In short, the tentatively named NP DataHub is a cloud-based data intelligence platform for philanthropies and nonprofits that offers algorithmic-based insights for more strategic community investment. 

Often, nonprofits have little direction in collaborating with other organizations with similar missions based on a data-specific composition and geography. Grant-making foundations have a similar problem. Both also have few pathways to combine resources through donor engagement to holistically fund or approach a societal problem, of which public data addressing these problems is more readily and publicly accessible. Instead, these processes are piece-mealed. The objective is to create a platform that links pathways and explains the findings while building on the basic historical data that can be found on other non-profit document aggregation websites.
